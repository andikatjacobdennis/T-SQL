### Example Queries

Here are a few examples of queries you can practice with the setup:

```sql
-- Retrieve all product names and their prices
SELECT ProductName, Price FROM Products;

-- Find the total sales amount
SELECT SUM(SaleAmount) AS TotalSales FROM Sales;

-- Update the price of a product
UPDATE Products SET Price = 349.99 WHERE ProductName = 'Smartphone';

-- Create a view showing total sales by product
CREATE VIEW ProductSalesView AS
SELECT ProductName, SUM(SaleAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Products
LEFT JOIN Sales ON Products.ProductID = Sales.ProductID
GROUP BY ProductName;
```
