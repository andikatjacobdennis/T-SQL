| **Indexes** | Create an index on the `ProductName` column for faster searches. | `CREATE INDEX idx_ProductName ON Products (ProductName);` |
| | Create an index on the `SaleDate` column in the `Sales` table. | `CREATE INDEX idx_SaleDate ON Sales (SaleDate);` |

 CLUSTERED INDEX idx_ProductID ON Products (ProductID);` |
| | Create a non-clustered index on the `ProductName` column. | `CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_ProductName ON Products (ProductName);` |
| **Keys & Constraints** | Ensure that the `ProductCode` column in the `Products` table is unique. | `ALTER TABLE Products ADD CONSTRAINT UQ_ProductCode UNIQUE (ProductCode);` |
| | Add a primary key on the `ProductID` column in the `Products` table. | `ALTER TABLE Products ADD CONSTRAINT PK_ProductID PRIMARY KEY (ProductID);` |
| | Create a foreign key in the `Sales` table that references the `ProductID` in the `Products` table. | `ALTER TABLE Sales ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Product FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID);` |
| | Create a composite key on the `ProductID` and `OrderID` columns in the `OrderDetails` table. | `ALTER TABLE OrderDetails ADD CONSTRAINT PK_ProductOrder PRIMARY KEY (ProductID, OrderID);` |
| | Define an alternate key on the `ProductCode` column in the `Products` table. | `ALTER TABLE Products ADD CONSTRAINT AK_ProductCode UNIQUE (ProductCode);` |
| **Views** | Create a view that shows product names and total sales for each product. | `CREATE VIEW ProductSalesView AS SELECT Products.ProductName, SUM(Sales.SaleAmount) AS TotalSales FROM Products LEFT JOIN Sales ON Products.ProductID = Sales.ProductID GROUP BY Products.ProductName;` |
| | Update the `ProductSalesView` to include the average sale amount. | `CREATE OR ALTER VIEW ProductSalesView AS SELECT Products.ProductName, SUM(Sales.SaleAmount) AS TotalSales, AVG(Sales.SaleAmount) AS AverageSales FROM Products LEFT JOIN Sales ON Products.ProductID = Sales.ProductID GROUP BY Products.ProductName;` |

| **Stored Procedures & Functions** | Create a stored procedure to add a new sale record to the `Sales` table. | `CREATE PROCEDURE AddSale @ProductID INT, @SaleAmount DECIMAL(10, 2), @SaleDate DATE AS BEGIN INSERT INTO Sales (ProductID, SaleAmount, SaleDate) VALUES (@ProductID, @SaleAmount, @SaleDate); END;` |
| | Write a function that calculates the total sales for a given product. | `CREATE FUNCTION TotalSalesForProduct (@ProductID INT) RETURNS DECIMAL(10, 2) AS BEGIN RETURN (SELECT SUM(SaleAmount) FROM Sales WHERE ProductID = @ProductID); END;` |
| **Advanced Concepts** | Write a loop to update prices for all products that meet a specific condition. | `DECLARE @ProductID INT, @NewPrice DECIMAL(10, 2) SET @NewPrice = 100; DECLARE ProductCursor CURSOR FOR SELECT ProductID FROM Products WHERE Price < @NewPrice OPEN ProductCursor FETCH NEXT FROM ProductCursor INTO @ProductID WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 BEGIN UPDATE Products SET Price = @NewPrice WHERE ProductID = @ProductID FETCH NEXT FROM ProductCursor INTO @ProductID END CLOSE ProductCursor DEALLOCATE ProductCursor;` |
| | Create a trigger that updates the stock quantity in the `Products` table after every insert into `Sales`. | `CREATE TRIGGER UpdateStock AFTER INSERT ON Sales FOR EACH ROW BEGIN UPDATE Products SET StockQuantity = StockQuantity - 1 WHERE ProductID = NEW.ProductID; END;` |
| | Grant a user permission to view the `Products` table but revoke their ability to delete records. | `GRANT SELECT ON Products TO [username]; REVOKE DELETE ON Products FROM [username];` |
| **Transactions** | Begin a transaction for inserting a new product and updating the stock quantity. | `BEGIN TRANSACTION; INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, Category) VALUES (2, 'Tablet', 199, 'Electronics'); UPDATE Products SET StockQuantity = StockQuantity + 10 WHERE ProductID = 2; COMMIT TRANSACTION;` |
| | Rollback a transaction if an error occurs during multiple inserts. | `BEGIN TRANSACTION; BEGIN TRY INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, Category) VALUES (3, 'Laptop', 799, 'Electronics'); INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, Category) VALUES (4, 'Keyboard', 49, 'Accessories'); COMMIT TRANSACTION; END TRY BEGIN CATCH ROLLBACK TRANSACTION; END CATCH;` |
| | Save a transaction state so that it can be rolled back later. | `BEGIN TRANSACTION; INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, Category) VALUES (5, 'Mouse', 25, 'Accessories'); SAVE TRANSACTION SavePoint1; INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, Category) VALUES (6, 'Monitor', 150, 'Electronics'); ROLLBACK TRANSACTION SavePoint1; COMMIT TRANSACTION;` |
| | Check the status of the current transaction. | `SELECT @@TRANCOUNT;` |
