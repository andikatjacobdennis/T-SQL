### What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used to interact with and manage relational databases. It enables users to perform various operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data, as well as defining and modifying database structures (like tables, indexes, and views).

### History of SQL

1. **Early Development (1970s)**
   - SQL was developed in the early 1970s by IBM researchers Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce. It was originally named **SEQUEL** (Structured English Query Language) and was designed to retrieve and manipulate data stored in IBM's original relational database management system, **System R**.
   - The name SEQUEL was later shortened to SQL due to a trademark conflict.

2. **Adoption by Relational Databases**
   - In 1979, Oracle Corporation became the first company to release a commercial SQL-based RDBMS (relational database management system).
   - SQL was later adopted by other database vendors, including IBM (with DB2) and Microsoft (with SQL Server), and it became a common language for database operations.

3. **Standardization**
   - In 1986, SQL was recognized as a standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
   - It became an international standard (ISO) in 1987.
   - Over time, new versions of SQL have been standardized, adding advanced features such as support for procedural extensions (e.g., PL/SQL, T-SQL) and large data types (e.g., BLOBs, CLOBs).

4. **Continued Evolution**
   - SQL has evolved over the years to include features such as triggers, stored procedures, recursive queries, window functions, and more, adapting to the growing complexity of modern applications.

### Key features of SQL include:

- **Data Definition**: SQL provides commands like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` to define or modify the structure of database objects such as tables.
- **Data Manipulation**: Commands such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` allow modification of the data.
- **Data Querying**: SQL allows users to retrieve specific data using commands like `SELECT`.
- **Data Control**: Commands like `GRANT` and `REVOKE` help control access to the database.
- **Transaction Control (TCL)**: SQL supports transaction management to ensure data consistency.
